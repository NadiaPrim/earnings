```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library (ggplot2)
library(foreign)
setwd("~/Downloads/ARM_Data/earnings")
earns <- read.dta("heights.dta")
```

## Earnings depend on height

A little known fact is that earnings depend on height.

```{r}
fit5 <- summary(lm(earn ~height +sex, data= earns))
```
As we can see it is a small effect relative to sex


```{r interaction}
ggplot(data= earns, aes(x=height, y= earn, color= sex))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method= "lm", aes(group=sex))+
  geom_smooth(method="lm", color ="red")+ 
  theme_bw()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
